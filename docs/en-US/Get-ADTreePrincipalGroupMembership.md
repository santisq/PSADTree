# Get-ADTreePrincipalGroupMembership

## SYNOPSIS

`tree` like cmdlet for Active Directory Principals Group Membership.

## SYNTAX

### Depth (Default)

```powershell
Get-ADTreePrincipalGroupMembership
    [-Identity] <String>
    [-Server <String>]
    [-Credential <PSCredential>]
    [-Depth <Int32>]
    [-ShowAll]
    [-Exclude <String[]>]
    [<CommonParameters>]
```

### Recursive

```powershell
Get-ADTreePrincipalGroupMembership
    [-Identity] <String>
    [-Server <String>]
    [-Credential <PSCredential>]
    [-Recursive]
    [-ShowAll]
    [-Exclude <String[]>]
    [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

The `Get-ADTreePrincipalGroupMembership` cmdlet gets the Active Directory groups that have a specified user, computer, group, or service account as a member and displays them in a tree like structure. This cmdlet also helps identifying Circular Nested Groups.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Get group memberships for a user

```powershell
PS ..\PSADTree\> Get-ADTreePrincipalGroupMembership john.doe
```

By default, this cmdlet uses `-Depth` with a default value of `3`.

### Example 2: Get the recursive group memberships for a user

```powershell
PS ..\PSADTree\> Get-ADTreePrincipalGroupMembership john.doe -Recursive
```

### Example 3: Get group memberships for all computers under an Organizational Unit

```powershell
PS ..\PSADTree\> Get-ADComputer -Filter * -SearchBase 'OU=myOU,DC=myDomain,DC=com' |
    Get-ADTreePrincipalGroupMembership
```

You can pipe strings containing an identity to this cmdlet. [__`ADObject`__](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.activedirectory.management.adobject?view=activedirectory-management-10.0) instances piped to this cmdlet are also supported.

### Example 4: Find any Circular Nested Groups from previous example

```powershell
PS ..\PSADTree\> Get-ADComputer -Filter * -SearchBase 'OU=myOU,DC=myDomain,DC=com' |
    Get-ADTreePrincipalGroupMembership -Recursive |
    Where-Object IsCircular
```

### Example 5: Get group memberships for a user in a different Domain

```powershell
PS ..\PSADTree\> Get-ADTreePrincipalGroupMembership john.doe -Server otherDomain
```

### Example 6: Get group memberships for a user, including processed groups

```powershell
PS ..\PSADTree\> Get-ADTreePrincipalGroupMembership john.doe -ShowAll
```

By default, previously processed groups will be marked as _"Processed Group"_ and their hierarchy will not be displayed.
The `-ShowAll` switch indicates that the cmdlet should display the hierarchy of all previously processed groups.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The use of this switch should not infer in a great performance cost, for more details see the parameter details.

## PARAMETERS

### -Credential

Specifies a user account that has permission to perform this action. The default is the current user.

Type a user name, such as __User01__ or __Domain01\User01__, or enter a __PSCredential__ object generated by the `Get-Credential` cmdlet. If you type a user name, you're prompted to enter the password.

```yaml
Type: PSCredential
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Depth

Determines the number of nested group memberships included in the recursion.
By default, only 3 levels of recursion are included. `Get-ADTreePrincipalGroupMembership` emits a warning if the levels exceed this number.

```yaml
Type: Int32
Parameter Sets: Depth
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: 3
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Exclude

Specifies an array of one or more string patterns to be matched as the cmdlet enumerates child principals.
Any matching principal is excluded from the output.
Wildcard characters are accepted.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Patterns are tested against the principal's `.SamAccountName` property.

```yaml
Type: String[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: True
```

### -Identity

Specifies an Active Directory principal by providing one of the following property values:

- A DistinguishedName
- A GUID
- A SID (Security Identifier)
- A sAMAccountName
- A UserPrincipalName

See [`IdentityType` Enum](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.accountmanagement.identitytype?view=dotnet-plat-ext-7.0) for more information.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: DistinguishedName

Required: True
Position: 0
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByPropertyName, ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Recursive

Specifies that the cmdlet should get all group membership of the specified principal.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: Recursive
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Server

Specifies the AD DS instance to connect to by providing one of the following values for a corresponding domain name or directory server.

Domain name values:

- Fully qualified domain name
- NetBIOS name

Directory server values:

- Fully qualified directory server name
- NetBIOS name
- Fully qualified directory server name and port

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -ShowAll

By default, previously processed groups will be marked as _"Processed Group"_ and their hierarchy will not be displayed.
This switch forces the cmdlet to display the full hierarchy including previously processed groups.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This cmdlet uses a caching mechanism to ensure that Active Directory Groups are only queried once per Identity.
> This caching mechanism is also used to reconstruct the pre-processed group's hierarchy when the `-ShowAll` switch is used, thus not incurring a performance cost.
> The intent behind this switch is to not clutter the cmdlet's output by default.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters

This cmdlet supports the common parameters. For more information, see [about_CommonParameters](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

## INPUTS

### System.String

You can pipe strings containing an identity to this cmdlet. [`ADObject`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.activedirectory.management.adobject?view=activedirectory-management-10.0) instances piped to this cmdlet are also supported.

## OUTPUTS

### PSADTree.TreeGroup
